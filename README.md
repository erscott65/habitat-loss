#column A "Survey" indicates during what survey data were taken
#column B "Bag" indicates from which of 45 mesocosm habitats data were taken
#column C "Block" indicates the sampling block 
#column D "Year" indicates the year data were collected
#Column E "Treatment" indicates the habitat loss treatment experienced by the mesocosm habiat
  #Treatment "C" is Control
  #Treatment "R" is habitat loss wiythout simplification
  #Treatment "H" is habitat loss with simplification
#column F "PlantNumber" indicates the number of the individual plant within a mesocosm habitat from which data were taken 
#column G "Plant" indicates the species of the individual plant
  #Plant "A" is Asclepias tuberosa
  #Plant "B" is Baptisia alba
  #Plant "C" is Solidago altissima
  #Plant "D" is Mondarda fistulosa
  #Plant "E" is Echinacea purpurea
  #Plant "F" is Opuntia humifusa
#column H "CommonSp" indicates which plant species was common in the mesocosm habitat
  #Plant "A" is Asclepias tuberosa
  #Plant "B" is Baptisia alba
  #Plant "C" is Solidago altissima
#columns I - HF are names or identifiers for morphospecies found in the experiment

#numbers in columns I-HF indicate numbers of arthropod individuals of that species found on a specific plant
#only data from Survey == Post1 and year == 2019 were used in analysis for the manuscript titled:
"Habitat loss and simplification lower arthropod richness but not diversity"
